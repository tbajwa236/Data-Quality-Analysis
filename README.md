# Data-Quality-Analysis
The data that I have decided to analyze and ultimately improve the quality is year 2018 of the Vancouver business licence database found here: https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/business-licences/table/?disjunctive.status&amp;disjunctive.businesssubtype&amp;refine.issueddate=2018.  The data consists of 58,628 records and 24 columns describing it. The project starts off with an initial assessment of the data (column by column) and aims to identify the deficiencies in the current database set up. Finally, recommendations are provided to maintains data integrity going forward.
